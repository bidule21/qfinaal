# QFinaal
Shooting sport competition finals ranking and results display software. Part of a set of programs for [Protokollitaja](https://github.com/ymeramees/protokollitaja).

Unfortunately, main part of the code is quite ugly, as this project was started in 2007 when I had just started learning Qt and programming in general. Quality of the code has (hopefully) improved over the years.

As it was initially developed for national competitions, the program is in Estonian language. Adding translation framework and translation to English is planned sometime in future.

### Main Features
* Currently only finals for ISSF prone, air rifle and air pistol diciplines are supported
* Results display on a separate screen with automatic ranking and targets view
* Serial connection with Disag target scoring machines RM III Universal and RM IV
* Connection with electronic targets for live capturing of results
* Start list import
* Results export to .xls, .csv and *.txt files
* Simulation of results from electronic targets with [Prototester](https://github.com/ymeramees/prototester)
